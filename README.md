# M_2_Embedded_-Seat_Heat_Monitor_System
•	In the locations the place snow falls or temperature is less,that is round zero diploma centigrade, human beings experience remedy if the vehicle seats are heat whilst travelling.

•	In this task Microcontroller ATMega 328 is used to manipulate seat temperature.

•	Program is designed like Heater begins operation solely if man or woman is sitting on seat and heater swap is closed.

•	When each above prerequisites are real Temperature sensor starts offevolved sensing tempraure of seat.

•	If seat temperature is extra than 25 deg centigrade,there will be no furnish to heater due to the fact seat is heat enough.

•	If temperature is much less than 25 deg PWM output drives the heater driver circuit.

•	PWM output and temperature values are inversely proportional i,e lesser the temperature extra price of PWM sign will power the heater.

•	For exceptional vary of temperature values exceptional PWM price sign is generated.
When temperature rises above 25 deg,PWM sign will be 0(low).

•	All this opeartion is automated and additionally temperature vary is transmitted to serial output.
